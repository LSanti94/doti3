2018-01-26 23:54:02	SmashingX	no space left but dd keeps working
2018-01-26 23:54:02	Dagmar	ah
2018-01-26 23:54:28	SmashingX	I’m also moving a file out of the FS so I can have more free space

2018-01-26 23:55:33	SmashingX	it’s because it’s waiting on mv to free up space?
2018-01-26 23:55:33	hkumar006c	how do you know its working?
2018-01-26 23:55:49	Dagmar	`iostat 2`
2018-01-26 23:56:00	SmashingX	hkumar006c: becasuse when it’s not working anynore it says no space left on device
2018-01-26 23:56:05	SmashingX	also I see it working with top
2018-01-26 23:56:05	Dagmar	If you see zeros for the USB device, you know it's just stopped writing

2018-01-26 23:56:45	SmashingX	I’m moving a file to a USB drive to free up space
2018-01-26 23:56:47	Dagmar	You didn't seriously -20 it did you?
2018-01-26 23:56:52	SmashingX	I did
2018-01-26 23:57:00	SmashingX	there’s no other option at this point
2018-01-26 23:57:07	Dagmar	You might want to bring that back down to say... -10 or perhaps just -3
2018-01-26 23:57:23	Dagmar	...or even -1.
2018-01-26 23:57:30	SmashingX	what?
2018-01-26 23:57:34	SmashingX	why
2018-01-26 23:57:35	Dagmar	Things like cron jobs that keep the system alive might be a bit more important
2018-01-26 23:57:42	SmashingX	no
2018-01-26 23:57:48	hkumar006c	dont change the niceness period
2018-01-26 23:57:50	Dagmar	Have yuo looked at the list of all the processes on your box and their nice levels?
2018-01-26 23:57:52	SmashingX	nothing is more important than freeing up space right now
2018-01-26 23:57:56	SmashingX	I don’t care about cron

2018-01-26 23:58:15	phogg	SmashingX: you only need to make the process one level less nice than any other process
2018-01-26 23:58:19	SmashingX	if I don’t free up space on time dd will brak
2018-01-26 23:58:25	SmashingX	break
2018-01-26 23:58:28	Dagmar	Well, less nice than _user_ processes
2018-01-26 23:58:34	SmashingX	and all my time would be wasted
2018-01-26 23:58:35	phogg	Dagmar: yes, I should have said
2018-01-26 23:58:49	Dagmar	You really don't want it being less nice than important kernel things keeping the system alive
2018-01-26 23:58:55	SmashingX	pfff
2018-01-26 23:59:07	Dagmar	Something that's very simple like dd can readily _squeeze everything else out of getting any timeslices_

2018-01-26 23:59:39	Dagmar	I'm not certain but I suspect it's rather possible to stuff up filesystem writes entirely by preventing kjournald from updating the journal.
2018-01-26 23:59:46	Dagmar	hint hint

2018-01-27 00:00:00	Dagmar	dd not appearing to be generating read io on the source media might be a clue
2018-01-27 00:00:01	phogg	SmashingX: it's not a good idea to go to -20; you can interfere with the kernel. Use -19 or above.

2018-01-27 00:00:30	badboyjer	i didnt have any OS available
2018-01-27 00:00:32	Dagmar	Assuming he can still change it back, returning it to a _reasonable_ value might let the system recover
