2018-01-27 01:26:11	Roden	I'm trying to find a solution for this thing, you know?  There's probably an array of potential issues to consider.  So, if I have an ISO with pre-installed programs, and each program is pre-configured, then the configuration file will go out to 250 computers, right?  If each computer has a different host name, and the config file requires a specific host name, I think the program using that config file will always break.

Once you have created them, whoever creates the VMs will use whatever NICs have already been set up. If they want new ones, yeah, a user with kvm/qemu permissions (in the group) would be able to create new bridged NICs.
